#### How can I configure CDN for Cloud Run services?

Since you canâ€™t use [Cloud HTTP\(S\) Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/) with Cloud Run, you cannot use [Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/).

However, you can have CDN from [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) by:

* responding to requests with a [`Cache-Control` header](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/manage-cache#set_cache-control), and
* configuring a [rewrite configuration in `firebase.json`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/cloud-run#direct_requests_to_container) of your Firebase app.
